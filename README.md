Each page includes command names, descriptions, and usage instructions.
*   Each command starts with a prefix (the default prefix is `!`). 
*   Required arguments are surrounded by `< >`. For example, to view a specific Overwatch League team, the instructions will say to use `!team <teamname>`.
*   Optional arguments are surrounded by `[]`.  For example, to view all social media links for a specific Overwatch League team, the instructions will say to use `!team <teamname> [accounts]`. The command can still be used normally without the optional arguments.
